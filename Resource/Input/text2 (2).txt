This is the first simile in a poem that is filled with similes, as many as four hundred of them in the three cantiche. Here, in response to the first of them, it is perhaps helpful to observe that 'similes' in Dante are varied, and perhaps fall into three rough categories: 'classical' similes, like this one, perfectly balanced and grammatically correct; 'improper classical' similes, which are similarly balanced but not expressed with grammatical precision; simple comparisons, which are brief and unembellished. There will be more along these lines in response to individual similes and comparisons. For a study in English of the Dantean simile see Richard Lansing, From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's “Commedia” (Ravenna: Longo, 1977); for bibliography, see Madison U. Sowell, “A Bibliography of the Dantean Simile to 1981,” Dante Studies 101 (1983), 167-80.

The show made its UK debut on Channel 4 on February 14, 2008. The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot E4 prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009 at 9:00 p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00 p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.[138] The fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011. Season 5 began airing on November 3, 2011 at 8:00 p.m. as part of E4's Comedy Thursdays, acting as a lead-in to the channel's newest comedy, Perfect Couples. Episode 19, the highest-viewed episode of the season, attracted 1.4 million viewers.[139] Season 6 premiered on November 15, 2012, with 1.89 million viewers and a further 469,000 on the time shift channel, bringing the total to 2.31 million, E4's highest viewing ratings of 2012, and the highest the channel had received since June 2011. The sixth season returned in mid 2013 to finish airing the remaining episodes.[140] Season 7 premiered on E4 on October 31, 2013 at 8:30pm and hit multiple ratings records this season. The second half of season seven aired in mid 2014.[141] The eighth season premiered on E4 on October 23, 2014 at 8:30 p.m.[142] During its eighth season, The Big Bang Theory shared its 8:30 p.m. time period with fellow CBS comedy, 2 Broke Girls. Following the airing of the first eight episodes of that show's fourth season, The Big Bang Theory returned to finish airing its eighth season on March 19, 2015.
