The first of the 14,233 lines that constitute the Comedy immediately establishes a context for the poem that is both universal and particular. It also immediately compels a reader to realize that this is a difficult text, one that may not be read passively, but must be 'interpreted.' And the exegetical tradition that has grown upon (and sometimes over) the text is so responsive to these characteristics that it often seems to overwhelm its object. There are so many issues raised in the poem, so many raised by its commentators, that one reads Francesco Mazzoni's extraordinarily helpful gloss to this single verse with admiration and instruction without, at first, even noticing that it is twelve pages in length.

The Big Bang Theory started off quietly in Canada, but managed to garner major success in later seasons. The Big Bang Theory is telecast throughout Canada via the CTV Television Network in simultaneous substitution with cross-border CBS affiliates. Now immensely popular in Canada, The Big Bang Theory is also rerun daily on the Canadian cable channel The Comedy Network.

The season 4 premiere garnered an estimated 3.1 million viewers across Canada. This is the largest audience for a sitcom since the series finale of Friends. The Big Bang Theory has pulled ahead and has now become the most-watched entertainment television show in Canada.
